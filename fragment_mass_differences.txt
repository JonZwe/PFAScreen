Here a small subset is provided:

CF2, C2F4, C3F6
HF, H2F2
C8H3F13, C10H3F17, C12H3F21, C14H3F25
CF2SO3
CF2O
CF3, C2F5, C3F7
SF5
F

Note that depending on the intensity threshold and the mass tolerance some mass differences can lead to high false positive rates.
Therefore, a pre-filering step by MD or MD/C-m/C can be very useful.
